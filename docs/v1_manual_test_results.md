# Example Workflow

## User Account Creation Example Flow

Yaseminâ€™s friend Emily, a Playlistify user and self-proclaimed music connoisseur, wants to prove she has better taste in music than her and invites Yasemin to a Playlistify competition. Yasemin accepts the challenge and starts by signing up for a Playlistify account to create her new user account.

### Step 1: Yasemin Creates an Account
Yasemin navigates to the signup page to create her account. She provides her details and sends a request to create her new profile:

**Yasemin calls POST /user/signup with the following details:**

```json
{
    "username": "YazOnPlaylistify",
    "name": "Yasemin Akkaya"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
    "message": "Account created successfully",
    "userid": "user12345"
}
```

### Step 2: Yasemin Logs In
After her account is created, Yasemin needs to log in to access the competition features and set up her profile.

**Yasemin calls POST /user/login with her credentials:**

```json
{
    "username": "YazOnPlaylistify"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
    "message": "Login successful"
}
```

### Step 3: Yasemin Logs Off
After browsing through the Playlistify platform, Yasemin decides to log off for the day and rest before the competition.

**Yasemin calls POST /user/logoff with the token received during login:**

**Response:**

```json
{
    "message": "Logoff successful"
}
```
