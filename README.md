## Description

Our project is a social music platform with a unique twist: **Gamified Music Discovery***. Users can challenge each other to create the best playlist for specific scenarios—like workouts, road trips, or relaxing evenings—by participating in **live playlist competitions**. These competitions take place in real-time, with users racing to submit their playlists before the timer runs out. Other users vote on their favorite playlists during or after the event. This system fosters creativity, friendly competition, and real-time interaction, making music discovery a more dynamic, community-driven experience.
