##Description
Our project is a social music platform with a unique twist: **Gamified Music Disocvery**. Users can challenge each other to create the best playlist for specific scenarios—like workouts, road trips, or relaxing evenings—by participating in weekly playlist competitions. Other users vote on their favorite playlists, with winners gaining recognition and special rewards. This system encourages creativity and friendly competition, making music discovery a more interactive and community-driven experience.
